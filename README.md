# 🚢 Titanic Survival Predictor – Logistic Regression with Streamlit

This project is a web application that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived or not, based on input features like age, class, gender, fare, etc.

It uses a **Logistic Regression model** trained on the Titanic dataset and is deployed as a **Streamlit app**.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- 🔍 Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset
- 🧼 Preprocessed data (missing values, encoding, scaling)
- 🧠 Built a Logistic Regression model
- 📈 Evaluated using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC AUC
- 🌐 Created a user-friendly **Streamlit web app** for predictions
- 💾 Model saved and reused using `pickle`

## 🚀 Features in the Streamlit App

- Interactive sliders and inputs for passenger data
- Instant prediction of survival
- Probability score for survival chance
- Clean UI and responsive layout
